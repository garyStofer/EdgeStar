
0.) How does INA138 + schmitt circuit work? function descrition needed 
		Would not a few simple Cmos 555 do the same work with less and smaller more reliable components. 

1.) What is JP1 used for? can it be replaced with inline test points ? (confusing with J1)
2.) What does J1 connect to ?  (confusing with JP1, consider rename), 	 What connects to H16
3.) Why are there multiple switches inline with battery instead of just one . (H20 to H21, & H18 to H17) Others ?
		can the required switches be placed on the edge of the battery board directly so that no external wires are needed?
4.) Reduce size of holes for external wires to not use screws and solder terminals. make strain relieve for wires or use connector with strain relieve.
5.) Give meaningful names to holes for switches etc .. better move switches onto edge of board eliminating wires.
6.) Only one connection out of the board for the main Power VCC rail ? ??????????
7.) Use library element from uStar.lib for the holes that go trough all boards.
8.) the signals not used on this board that come through the bolt pattern from the ustar board like "wire", "bus" and "vdd" 
		should be isoltaed, not tied together! Only signal GND should be tied among and the rest of the pcb's gnd
9.) Are connectors for "Supercap 1-3" still used ? Can they be removed? is this where the solar panels go?	 

10.)	Remove X1
11.) Remove C2
12.) Remove D3
13.) Remove R12
14.) Remove D5,R15,R17
15.) Remove D1,R5
16.) verify C5 == 10 uf -- wrong  footprint, pins interfere with 5V regulator
17.) footprint C4,C5 incorrect
18.) Place R12 whrere C2 used to be
19.) change all SMD to same size (805), reduce values of components 
20.) add bypass capacitors for Smitt trigger 
21.) Is Q1 trough Q3 apropriately sized ? especially Q1 -- maybe a resistor in the drain ??
22.) R14 is not needed for chosen push/pull output voltage supervisor 
23.) landing pattern for battery is too narrow and goes too far under battery -- consider slots for battery solder tabs.
24.) 3 pin header labeled Safecircuitpower is actually a Pololu 5V boost regulator, use pololu library element not just 3 pin header. -- not a good idea to have a vreg permanently on battery.
		Could the monitor circuit run directly of the battery saving the power drain from the reg? or be connectecd after the voltage monitor fet Q3 ??
25.) Tracework for power rails too thin !

26.) Voltage rating 5.5V on C1 and c3 too close to nominal volatge 5V
 
27.) Capacitor C4 100uf electret, leakage is affected by temperatur and age of component --potentially unstable in working environment
